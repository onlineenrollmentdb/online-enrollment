SUBJECT PREREQUISITE LOGIC
Student Load unit Max: 27
Below 27 is okay

Regular Student has no problem since they follow the curriculum so just enroll directly

Irregular Students this is a challenge lets start by year

1st year:
-if students has already grades on a subject then they are irregular ( this happens when students in there Highschool has already have that subject)
- students can select subject from 1st to 2nd since they have extra student load unit its there choice if they want to advance a subject

2nd year:
- students who failed a subject in 1st year is automatically an irregular they can retake that subject but on the same semester
- there is a limit on retaking can retake a subject up to 3 times and within 6 years of the first time you took it
- when the students subjects that failed has a prerequisite in the 1st year then he cant take that subject yet he needs to passed the 1st year subject
- now in 2nd semester there's this what they called Year Standing, a certain subject cant be enroll of you haven't completed the 2nd year 1st sem subjects.

3rd year:
- same from 2nd year
- they can select subjects from 1st to 2nd year and can also advance if they have not reach the Max Student Load

4th year:
- same from previous years
